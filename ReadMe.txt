This is my 2st web development project. 
I have used basic HTML and CSS in this project. 
I learned basic and fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS like flex display, css formatting, positioning etc. from this project.

Date started: 26.06.2021

Hours taken per day: 3 hours,2 hours
Total time taken: 4 hours

This is just my second project so it took me more time to work out the basics in a proper hands-on.
